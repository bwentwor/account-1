# FAQs about IAM
{: #iamfaq}

FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) might include questions about access control for resources, resource groups, account management, classic infrastructure resources, and access groups. 
{: shortdesc}

To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).

## What is {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management?
{: #whatisiam}
{: faq}
{: support}

Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources across the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform. A set of IBM Cloud services is enabled to use Cloud IAM for access control. They are organized into resource groups within your account to enable giving users quick and easy access to more than one resource at a time. Cloud IAM access policies are used to assign users and service IDs access to the resources within your account. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview).

## What is an IAM-enabled service?
{: #iam-enabled}
{: faq}

An IAM-enabled service must be in a resource group and access to the service is given by using IAM access policies. When you create an IAM-enabled service from the catalog, you must assign it to a resource group. For more information, see [Managing resources](/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource)

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is the only exception; it’s IAM-access controlled, but is always assigned to the default resource group. Therefore, you aren’t given the option to choose one when you create it from the catalog. And, it can’t be assigned to any other resource group.

## What is an IAM access policy?
{: #iam-policies}
{: faq}

An IAM access policy is how users, services IDs, and access groups in an account are given permission to work with a specific IAM-enabled service or resource instance, manage a resource group, or complete account management tasks. Each IAM access policy is made of a subject, target, and role. A subject is the who has the access. The target is what the subject can have access to. And, the role, whether it is a platform or service role depending on the context of the selected target, defines what level of access the subject has on the target. 

A subject is a user, service ID, or access group. A target can be a service in the account, a resource group in the account, a specific resource instance or type, or an account management service. And, the roles that are provided as choices depend on your selected target. Some services have service-specific roles that are defined, and some use platform roles only. To understand this concept visually, check out the following graphic with an outline of the options for creating an IAM policy:

![Creating IAM policies](images/IAM.svg "How IAM access policies are created by using a subject, target, and role")

## Are IAM and Cloud Foundry related?
{: #iam-cloudfoundry}
{: faq}

They aren't related. Cloud Foundry is an open source platform that uses organizations, spaces, and Cloud Foundry roles for access management. IAM is the secure way to authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources across the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform by using resource groups and IAM access roles.

The access management systems are entirely different. IAM resources belong to a resource group and Cloud Foundry resources belong to an organization and space. IAM access policies are used to provide access to resources in a resource group. And, Cloud Foundry org and space roles are used to provide users access to Cloud Foundry resources in a space. IAM doesn’t give you access to anything within Cloud Foundry spaces, and Cloud Foundry roles can’t grant access to resources within a resource group.

## How do I find out what I have access to?
{: #iam-access}
{: faq}
{: support}

In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select your name on the Users page. Then, depending on the access you're looking for, open the different tabs:

* To determine what access you have through the access groups you are assigned, select **Access groups**.
* To see IAM access policies that are assigned to you, select the **Access policies**.
* To see your Cloud Foundry access for all orgs and spaces, select **Cloud Foundry access**.

## What actions are mapped to each IAM role?
{: #action-mapping}
{: faq} 

When you invite a new user or assign a user IAM access, you can view the actions that are associated with each role. Click the **Actions for role** option to view a list of all actions that are mapped to a specific role. By reviewing the mapping of actions to roles, you can confidently know what access you're assigning. 

## How do I request access to a resource?
{: #request-access}
{: faq}

The account owner can update your access to any resource in the account, or you can contact any user who is assigned the administrator role on the service or service instance.

## How do I find the IAM ID for a user or myself?
{: #iam-id}
{: faq}

In the console, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**. Then, select your name or another user's name from the list. You can find the IAM ID for that user along with their email address on the User details page.

## How do I find and manage API Keys for a user or myself?
{: #iam-api-keys}
{: faq}

In the console, go to **Manage > Access (IAM) > API keys** to view and manage API keys that you have access to.

* For information about how to manage {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API keys that are associated with user identities, see [Managing user API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey).  
* For information about how to manage API keys that are associated with a service ID, see [Managing service ID API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys).
* For information about how to manage classic infrastructure API keys, see [Managing classic infrastructure API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-classic_keys).

## Where do I find service credentials?
{: #service-credentials}
{: faq}

To view an existing service credential for a service, go to your resource list by clicking the **Menu icon  ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg)** > **Resource list**, then select the name of the service to open its details. Click **Service credentials** to view the details. To save a copy of the service credentials, most services provide a Download link or an icon to copy the credentials to your clipboard. 

## Why use resource groups and access groups?
{: #resource-groups}
{: faq}

A resource group is a logical container for resources. When a resource is created, you assign it to a resource group and the resource can't be moved.

An access group is used to easily organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity to make access assignments easy. You can assign a single policy to an access group to grant all members those permissions. If you have more than one user or service ID that needs the same access, create an access group instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID.

By using both resource groups and access groups, you can streamline the access assignment policy by assigning a limited number of policies. You can organize all of the resources a specific group of users and service IDs needs access to in a single resource group, group all the users or service IDs into an access group, and then assign a single policy that grants access to all resources in the resource group.

For more information, see [Best practices for organizing resources and assigning access](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#how_access).

## How do I ensure that my users can create resources within a resource group?
{: #resources}
{: faq}
{: support}

To create a resource in a resource group, the user must have two access policies: one assigned to the resource group itself, and one assigned to the resources in the group. Access to the resource group itself is simply access to the container that organizes the resources, and this type of policy allows a user to view, edit, or manage access to the group, but not the resources within it. Access to services within the resource group enables a user to work with the service instances, which means the user can create a service instance.

So, minimally the user must have the following access:

* Viewer role or higher on the resource group itself
* Editor role or higher on the service or all services in the resource group

## How do I assign access to all resource groups?
{: #all-rgs}

To assign a user, service ID, or access group a policy on all resource groups, you have a couple of options:

* A policy for **All Identity and Access enabled services** in the **Account** with the **Viewer** resource group access role selected. However, you must also assign at least one platform or service role to assign this type of policy.
* A policy for **All Account Management Services** with the **Viewer** role or higher provides access to view all resource groups. However, be aware that this type of policy also assigns the role that you choose for each account management service, so it can be a powerful policy that enables a user to manage users, account settings, billing information, and more.
* A policy with **No service access** and a particular resource group selected as well as a resource group access role assigned. You can repeat this type of policy as needed for each available resource group in the account.

You can also assign access to individual resource groups with a policy on a service as long as you select a targeted resource group by name and assign a resource group access role.
{: tip}

## What access enables a user to work with a single resource?
{: #resources-and-rg}
{: faq}

A user must be assigned an access policy on the specific resource with at least the Viewer role assigned on the resource group itself that contains the resource. To assign this type of policy, see [Assigning access to resources](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources).


## What access do I need to provide others access?
{: #user-access}
{: faq}
{: support}

For IAM-enabled services, you must have Administrator role on the service or resource that you want to assign users access to. If you want to assign access to all services or resources in the account, you need a policy on all Identity and Access enabled services with the Administrator role. And, to assign users access to account management services, you must be assigned the Administrator role on the specific service or all account management services.

For Cloud Foundry services, you must have Cloud Foundry org and space manager roles to give access to Cloud Foundry resources.

For classic infrastructure, you must have the Manage user classic infrastructure permission and the service and device category permissions for the resources that you want to give the user access to.

## What's the difference between access to manage a resource group and access to resources within a resource group?
{: #providing-access}
{: faq}

When you have access to manage a resource group, you can view, edit the name, and manage access for the resource group itself depending on the assigned role. Access to a resource group itself doesn't give a user access to the resources within the group.

When you have access to resources within a resource group, you can edit, delete, and create instances, or have all management actions for the specified services within the resource group depending on the assigned role.

For example, platform management roles and actions for account management services, see [Platform roles table](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles#platformroles).

## Who can remove users?
{: #remove-users}
{: faq}

The account owner can remove any users from the account, and any user with the following access can remove users from an account:

* An IAM policy for the User management account management service with the Administrator role assigned and be the Cloud Foundry org manager if the user belongs to a Cloud Foundry org.
* If you have classic infrastructure in your account, then a user must have an IAM policy for the User management account management service with the Administrator role assigned, be the Cloud Foundry org manager if the user belongs to a Cloud Foundry org, and be an ancestor of the user in the classic infrastructure user hierarchy with the Manage user classic infrastructure permission assigned.

## How do I require IBMid multifactor authentication for my account?
{: #multi-factor}
{: faq}
{: support}

1. In the console, go to **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Settings**.
2. From the Account login section, select **Update** to select MFA for all users or non-federated users only.

For more information, see [Requiring MFA for users in your account](/docs/account?topic=account-enablemfa).

## What is the difference between service and platform roles?
{: #service-platform-roles}
{: faq}

Service and platform roles are two different types of roles:

* Platform roles are how you work with a service within an account such as creating instances, binding instances, and managing user's access to the service. For platform services these roles enable users to create resource groups and manage service IDs, for example. Platform roles are: administrator, editor, operator, and viewer.

* Service roles define the ability to perform actions on a service and are specific to every service such as performing API calls or accessing the UI. Service roles are: manager, writer, and reader. For more information about how these roles apply, refer to the specific service's documentation.

## What is the difference between a resource group and Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces?
{: #groups-organizations}
{: faq}

With the start of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, an open source platform service for access control and the organization of resources called Cloud Foundry was the single method for organizing and controlling access to resources. As {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has expanded, a new method was needed that might be used by all types of services and resources. Resource groups are now used to group and organize many types of resources, and IAM is used to consistently control access to services and resources. A number of services have already adopted by using resource groups and IAM, and more services will move over time to the new method for organizing resources and managing access.

Access control and account resource organization are the major differences between resource groups and Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces. Resource groups organize IAM-enabled services in an account that are access controlled by using IAM policies. Orgs and spaces are managed by using Cloud Foundry roles for access control, and Cloud Foundry resources are assigned to spaces. Orgs and spaces can be used to organize and control access to resources only within the Cloud Foundry realm, while resource groups and IAM can be used for multiple types of resources across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

## How do I assign a user full access as an account administrator?  
{: #account-administrator}
{: faq}
{: support}

To assign a user in your account full administrator access, go to **Manage > Access (IAM)** in the console, select the user's name, and assign the following access:

* An IAM policy with Administrator and Manager roles on All Identity and Access enabled services, which enables a user to create service instances and assign users access to all resources in the account.
* An IAM policy with Administrator role on All account management services, which enables a user to complete tasks like inviting and removing users, managing access groups, managing service IDs, managing private catalog offerings, and track billing and usage.
* The Super user permission set for classic infrastructure, which includes all of the available classic infrastructure permissions
* Cloud Foundry manager for all orgs, but only account owners can create the orgs.

## Can every user in my account see all the other users?
{: #users}
{: faq}

An account owner can view all users in the account and choose how users can view other users in the account on the Users page. An account owner can adjust the [user list visibility setting](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-user-setting) on the Settings page by selecting one of the following options:

* **Unrestricted view**: All users in your account can view everyone else in the account.
* **Restricted view**: Limits the ability to view users on the Users page to only those who have been granted explicit access, along with those who have visibility of other users through a shared Cloud Foundry org or a classic infrastructure user hierarchy relationship.


## Do I need to assign access to a user when I invite them to the account?
{: #account-invite}
{: faq}

No. You can invite users, and then assign access later.


## How do I add authentication into my web and mobile apps?
{: #appid}
{: faq}

IAM is used to manage access to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services and resources. With {{site.data.keyword.appid_full_notm}}, you can take cloud security one step further by adding authentication into your web and mobile apps. With just a few lines of code, you can easily secure your Cloud-native apps and services that run on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Ready to get started? [Check out the docs](/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-getting-started#getting-started).

## Where do I manage a user's access to infrastructure? 
{: #infrastructure-devices}
{: faq}
{: support}

Access for classic infrastructure starts with the user. For more information, see [Managing classic infrastructure access](/docs/account?topic=account-mngclassicinfra).

If you need to assign access to IAM-enabled infrastructure services, such as {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}, you assign access to a user or access group from the **Access policies** tab.

## How do I manage access for users previously assigned billing and support permissions in my SoftLayer account?
{: #migrated-permissions-faq}
{: faq}
{: support}

All permissions that were previously assigned in your SoftLayer account can be managed in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Account permissions for managing billing information and support cases are now available in [managing migrated SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-migrated_permissions). All users who were previously assigned these permissions in your SoftLayer account were migrated to these access groups, which are assigned the same level of access by using an IAM policy on the access group.

## How do I determine how many policies exist in my account?
{: #total-policies}
{: faq}

You can [check the number of policies in an account](/docs/account?topic=account-policy-limits) by using the CLI to ensure that you don't hit the limit for your account. 

## What does it mean for a user to be in pending state?
{: #pending-user}
{: faq}

A user who is list as `Pending` is a user who has been invited to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} but who hasn't accepted their invitation. On the Users page, the management actions for these users include resending the invitation or cancelling the invitation. 

When inspecting access group memberships or access policies in your account, you might see memberships or policies related to pending users that were created as part of the invite. These display with an IAM ID that uses the `BSS-`. This IAM ID is a placeholder for the memberships and policies until the user accepts the invitation. And, since the user hasn't registered with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, they can't retrieve an IAM access token to leverage the assigned acccess.  When the user accepts the invitation and registers with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, the ID in these memberships and policies is replaced with their assigned IAM ID.
